# Software Architecture #

> Single process. 

> Client / Server (2 processes collaborating). 

> 3 Tier systems (3 processes collaborating in chains).

> N Tier systems (N processes collaborating in chains).

> Service oriented architecture (lots of processes interacting with each other).

> Peer-to-peer architecture (lots of processes interacting without a central server).

> Hybrid architectures - combinations of the above architectures.

# Scaling #
``
	Imagine that you are buying a brand new car which can accommodate 4 people in it. Now, say 10 of your friends need to go for a vacation. What would you do?
``

> Would you buy a bigger car? - Vertical Scaling

> Would you buy one more Nissan car ? - Horizontal Scaling
